### Hello, friend! 👋

In a past life I was a **Creative Director and artist** - now I'm a developer interested in **language design, human-computer interfaces, and the generative possibilities of the web**. Some of my previous work is still up on my [website](https://nkozak.com/).

I recently finished a 12-week **[Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/)** batch, where I've focused on DSL's and learning about application deployment.

### What's going on now:

- ⛋ As I build other projects, I'm also maintaining [Svonix](https://github.com/nikokozak/svonix), a library for integrating Svelte with Phoenix.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a [cleaner way to view news from many outlets in Chile](https://lectorchile.com/) (where all news websites are plauged by a frustrating amount of pop-up ads). Repo: [CL News](https://github.com/nikokozak/cl_news)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on my custom DSL for the book Morphing Architecture. See: [Interactive MA](https://morphing-architecture.onrender.com/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better work with (in development), and deploy/manage databases.

### Other Projects:

- 👓 An **[interactive viewer](https://github.com/nikokozak/shapes-for-architects)** for the book [Morphing Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Morphing-Mathematical-Transformations-Architects-Designers/dp/1780674139/).
- 🌕 A **[moon calendar](https://github.com/nikokozak/moon)** for your terminal!
- 🛠️ A **[cad experiment](https://nkozak.com/assets/programs/ripl-1/index.html)** that tracks through some of my [thoughts](https://nkozak.com/code-interactive/rethinking-cad.html) on interaction design.
- 🦠 A **[text-based COVID tracker](https://github.com/nikokozak/covidpoem)** for Chile.
- ✍🏻 A **[complete rewrite]**(https://github.com/nikokozak/rc-badges-rewrite) of the [Recurse Center Swag Site](https://swag.recurse.com) with a hand-rolled Ruby framework, replacing a heavy React build.
- 🪶 An [Elixir-powered back-end](https://github.com/nikokozak/pluma_newsletter_api) for referral tracking, by synchronizing a local DB with Maichilmp's using web-hooks.
